# Installation

To use Python get Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

It's the best option for scientists since it packages all the required packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas...) with Python itself. It's available for Windows, Linux and MacOs.

For the actual IDE (where you code): Visual Studio Code is my favorite for Python. You can also use Spyder or PyCharm.

# Identation

The code in python is not terminated with semi colons like in many other programming languages (;). Instead it uses tabs and spaces to know what to run, in which order.


# Variables

You do not need to declare a variable. i.e. it is created the first time it's used, unlike in some other programming languages where you need to first declare (tell the code that you will use a variable called 'foo' of type 'float' for example and then actually use it - see C++, C, C#, Java...).

```python
x = 5 # can be used directly without declaration
y = 7
```
x, y are two variables in the code above. No need for any special code declaring the variables like you could see in C++:

```c++
int x; // declaration
int y;

x = 5;
y = 7;
```
